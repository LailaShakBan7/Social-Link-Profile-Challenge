### What I learned

Working with parent and child elements and to get the CSS properties to align as a group within the "wrapper" was a bit of a challenge for me but thankfully I managed to get some help through videos and tutorials.  


img {
    border-radius: 50%;
    width: 25%; 
    height: 25%; 
    object-fit: cover; 
    display: block;
    max-width: 100%;
    align-items: center;
}

.social-links {
    list-style: none;
    font-weight: var(--fw-600);
    align-items: center;
}

.link-item {
    text-decoration: none;
    width: 82%;
    padding: 10px;
    margin: 10px 0 15px 0;
    display: block;
    border-radius: 6px;
    color: var(--clr-White);
    background-color: var(--clr-Grey-700);
    text-align: center;    
}


### Continued development

Just need to keep practicing to improve and turning it into a muscle-memory.
